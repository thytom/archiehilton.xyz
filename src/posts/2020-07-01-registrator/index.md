I've been working on a Discord bot for my course which would allow them to
automatically admit new students into their Discord server, with little extra
effort needed by mentors and staff. Check the GitHub out
[here](https://github.com/thytom/registrator).

I started this project knowing nothing about NodeJS, so instead of creating a
detailed plan, I decided to just start writing code, and while this did take
more time, it was beneficial to my learning; it turns out that ad-libbing your
way through a language you barely know, in a framework you are equally clueless
in, using an API you didn't know existed till a few googles ago really forces
you to learn quickly. I'm now pretty confident writing in JavaScript, whereas if
you'd asked me two weeks ago I would be pretty hesitant to use it.
