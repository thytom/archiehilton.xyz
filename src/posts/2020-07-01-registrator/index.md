I've been working on a project for my university department's mentor programme,
a Discord bot which would allow them to automatically admit new students into
their Discord server, with little extra effort needed by the mentors themselves.
Check the GitHub out [here](https://github.com/thytom/registrator).

Perhaps the most important lesson I learned from working on this project is that
planning is crucial to saving time. If you don't consider all the requirements
and account for them in your plan before you even write a single line of code,
then you will pay for it in the time spent fixing it down the line.

That said, I am glad that I started this project in the way I did, even if it's
taking a lot longer than it needed to. Ad-libbing your way through a language
you barely know, in a framework you are equally clueless in, using an API you
didn't know existed till a few googles ago really forces you to learn quickly.
I'm now pretty confident writing in JavaScript, whereas if you'd asked me two
weeks ago I wouldn't even have a clue how to even set up a NodeJS project, let
alone write working code that I wouldn't be ashamed of showing to a real NodeJS
developer.
