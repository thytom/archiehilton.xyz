		<h1>Archie Hilton</h1>
		<p>I'm currently an undergraduate Computer Science student at the
		University of Nottingham.</p>

		<p>At the moment, I am most interested in software development and more
		specifically the optimisation of algorithms and programs. Thinks like
		time complexity, etc. That said, I always code a working program first,
		then look to make optimisations.</p>


		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<h3>Guitars</h3>
		<p>I play a lot of guitar, mostly just songs that I like at this point.
		I played in a band a few years ago, however haven't got any creative
		projects going on in this regard at the moment.</p>

		<p>I do repairs and modifications to all of my guitars myself. I own
		several, a lot of which I've customised to my liking. While my
		work isn't professional, I'd like to think that I give them a good
		life. My current favourite is my Epiphone Les Paul Custom:</p>

		<p>As far as I know, this guitar is made of parts we bought as a kit
		from ebay. It was a birthday present that my dad built for me, and I
		haven't asked much about it. I did a lot more work on it myself
		recently, adding that stripe, and modifying the electronics. The pickup
		selector acts as a simple on/off, while one of the volume pots has been
		repurposed as a smooth control between head and bridge pickup.</p>

		<p>Don't get too excited about the stripe. That's PVC tape. Like I said,
		not professional.</p>

		<h3>Music</h3>
		<p>Music has been one of my main passions for a long time. I mostly
		listen to rock, however also like a decent amount of EDM, jazz, blues,
		hip hop, etc. I'll probably enjoy any music you could play me, though
		artists that come off the top of my head include Foo Fighters, <b>Green
		Day</b>, <b>Deftones</b>, and <b>Royal Blood</b>.</p>

		<p>I also have an intermediate knowledge of audio production, as well as
		live performance and recording. I managed an open-mic gig every half
		term at my sixth form college, using the audio equipment from the music
		technology department.</p>

		<p>The experience was definitely helpful with my course at the time; I
		got the privilege to apply what I was learning in lessons to an actual
		practical situation, and often encountered issues where I had to adapt
		and improvise.</p>

		<p>I also performed live at these shows every time too, doing a
		15-minute set of whatever I wanted to play with my friends.</p>
