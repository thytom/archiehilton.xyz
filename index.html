			<p>dwmbar is a modular statusbar that I wrote with a friend in Bash,
			for the dwm tiling window manager. It essentially loops through a
			directory of scripts, takes all their outputs, and collates them
			into a statusbar which it displays. It sports a config where you can
			choose what "modules" to use, and which should disappear when an
			internet connection isn't available. You can check out the project
				<a href="https://www.github.com/thytom/dwmbar">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p>While I no longer use the program myself (on account of going
			back to Plasma), I'll come back to it when and if bugs ever need
			fixing. It's really not a big thing to maintain.</p>
