# CSnake, CppSnake & HSnake
2020-06-20 12:22

I posted a program on GitHub last year called CSnake; a terminal-based snake
game written in C. I had gone through two versions and the code was still awful.
The new [CSnake](https://github.com/thytom/csnake) repository is my attempt at
making it a lot cleaner, while still maintaining a relatively small program.

I then decided, why not try writing this in OO and functional? I chose C++ as my
OO language and Haskell as my functional, and came up with
[CppSnake](https://github.com/thytom/cppsnake) and
[HSnake](https://github.com/thytom/hsnake).

This proved as a great way to get more involved with each paradigm, as well as
stretch my legs with some C. Overall, I think the OO version is pretty good, but
the functional approach needs some work done (the IO parts get VERY messy).
